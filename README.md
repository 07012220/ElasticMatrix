# ElasticMatrix
The ElasticMatrix software implements the partial-wave method [1,3,4] to model elastic wave propagation in multi-layered anisotropic media up to transverse-isotropic symmetry when the wave propagation is along a plane of symmetry.

To view the html documentation in MATLAB:
help (or press F1) -> Supplemental Software -> ElasticMatrix Toolbox

- ./examples folder contains example scripts demonstrating some of the capabilities of the code.
- ./examples_mlx folder contains example scripts in the MATLAB live script style.
- ./documentation folder contains a reference list for the mathematical background.
- ./src-pw folder contains the source code for the partial wave method.

### Capabilities
Some of the code functionality:
- Plotting slowness profiles.
- Plotting reflection and transmission coefficients.
- Calculating the dispersion curves for simple plate structures.
- Plotting the, displacement and stress fields.
- Calculating the directivity of Fabry-Perot ultrasound sensors, see [1].

### Update log:
2019-08-20
- html documentation added for most example scripts.
- All Functions have been refactored.

2019-07-31
- Some functions in src-pw have been made static methods.
- Header documentation for every function.
- All functions in src-pw (Except calculateDispersionCurves) have been refactored to the BUG coding standard.

2019-07-18
- Reorder folders, delete some data and papers from documentation (replaced with a reference list).

2019-07-16
- Sorting of calculation parameters when calling .calculate needs 2 of 4, frequency + angle/phase-speed/wavenumber.
- Examples updated.

2019-07-12
- Dispersion curve algorithm is much faster.
- Examples folder is almost complete.

2019-07-04
- Dispersion curve tracing still needs updating.
- Automatic sorting of calculation parameters (angles, frequencies, wave-numbers, phase-speed) needs updating.
- Examples folder is still being populated.

2019-06-26: 
- All methods are implemented.
- Dispersion curve tracing needs to be made more robust, use the coarse method for now.
- Examples folder is being populated.

2019-05-11:
- Initial commit, there are a few bugs in the dispersion curve functionality.
- The examples folder needs to be updated, there are a few class method implementations which are missing.
