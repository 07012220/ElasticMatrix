# ElasticMatrix
The ElasticMatrix software implements the partial-wave method [1,3,4] to model elastic wave propagation in multi-layered anisotropic media up to transverse-isotropic symmetry when the wave propagation is along a plane of symmetry.

- ./examples folder contains example scripts demonstrating some of the capabilities of the code.
- ./examples_mlx folder contains example scripts in the MATLAB live script style.
- ./documentation folder contains a reference list for the mathematical background.
- ./src-pw folder contains the source code for the partial wave method.

### Capabilities
Some of the code functionality:
- Plotting slowness profiles.
- Plotting reflection and transmission coefficients.
- Calculating the dispersion curves for simple plate structures.
- Plotting the, displacement and stress fields.
- Calculating the directivity of Fabry-Perot ultrasound sensors, see [1].
